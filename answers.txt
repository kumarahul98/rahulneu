1. Tools to use git in GUI.
Ans. a. Github Desktop
     b. SourceTree
     c. GitKraken
     d. SmartGit
     e. Git Cola

2. Use of "-u" git push.
Ans. "Upstream" would refer to the main repo that other people will be 
    pulling from, e.g. your GitHub repo. The -u option automatically 
    sets that upstream for you, linking your repo to a central one. 
    That way, in the future, Git "knows" where you want to push to
     and where you want to pull from, so you can use git pull or 
     git push without arguments. 

3. What is "origin" in  git push origin master?
Ans. It is tag name of the remote repo which can be later used instead of url.
